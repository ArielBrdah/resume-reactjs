      <p>
        I am a web developer currently pursuing a master's degree. I have worked
        as a frontend developer for over a year. I have also worked on personal
        projects involving mainly MERN stack. I have done mostly frontend
        development, but I am also interested in backend development. I am
        always open to new challenges.
